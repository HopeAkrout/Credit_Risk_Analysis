# Credit_Risk_Analysis

This project involves evaluating data using a number of different technigues to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes in order to assess credit card risk.

## Overview

Using a dataset from LendingClub, the project is tasked with creating algorithms to oversample, undersample, use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling, use ensemble learner models that reduce bias on the dataset to predict credit risk.  In using five different methods, one can evaluate the performance of each model to recommend the best approach for credit risk prediction. 

## Results

* Oversampling

	* Naive Random Oversampling

	* SMOTE Oversampling

* Undersampling using ClusterCentroids

* Combination (Over and Under) Sampling using SMOTEENN

* Ensemble Learners

	* Balanced Random Forest Classifier

	* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
